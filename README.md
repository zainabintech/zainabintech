## Hi, I'm Zainab 👋  


🎓 Cybersecurity Senior Student

## 👩‍💻 About Me  

I enjoy learning how systems work, how attacks happen, and how to protect against them.

I also like to learn new technologies and work on different kinds of projects that are sometimes not specifically cybersecurity-related.
